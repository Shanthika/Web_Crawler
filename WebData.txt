C (, as in the letter c) is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language, including operating systems, as well as various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems.
C was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 at Bell Labs. It was created to make utilities running on Unix. Later, it was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system[6]. Through 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. Nowadays, it is one of the most widely used programming languages[7][8] with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems.  C has been standardized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) since 1989 (see ANSI C) and subsequently by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
C is an imperative procedural language.  It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler, to provide low-level access to memory, to provide language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, and to require minimal run-time support.  Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming.  A standards-compliant C program that is written with portability in mind can be compiled for a very wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code.  The language has become available on a very wide range of platforms, from embedded microcontrollers to supercomputers.
Overview
Like most imperative languages in the ALGOL tradition, C has facilities for structured programming and allows lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations.  In C, all executable code is contained within subroutines, which are called "functions" (although not in the strict sense of functional programming). Function parameters are always passed by value. Pass-by-reference is simulated in C by explicitly passing pointer values. C program source text is free-format, using the semicolon as a statement terminator and curly braces for grouping blocks of statements.
The C language also exhibits the following characteristics:
There is a small, fixed number of keywords, including a full set of control flow primitives: for, if/else, while, switch, and do/while. User-defined names are not distinguished from keywords by any kind of sigil.
There are a large number of arithmetical and logical operators, such as +, +=, ++, &, ~, etc.
More than one assignment may be performed in a single statement.
Function return values can be ignored when not needed.
Typing is static, but weakly enforced: all data has a type, but implicit conversions may be performed.
Declaration syntax mimics usage context. C has no "define" keyword; instead, a statement beginning with the name of a type is taken as a declaration. There is no "function" keyword; instead, a function is indicated by the parentheses of an argument list.
User-defined (typedef) and compound types are possible.
Heterogeneous aggregate data types (struct) allow related data elements to be accessed and assigned as a unit.
Union is a structure with overlapping members; only the last member stored is valid.
Array indexing is a secondary notation, defined in terms of pointer arithmetic. Unlike structs, arrays are not first-class objects; they cannot be assigned or compared using single built-in operators. There is no "array" keyword, in use or definition; instead, square brackets indicate arrays syntactically, for example month[11].
Enumerated types are possible with the enum keyword. They are freely interconvertible with integers.
Strings are not a separate data type, but are conventionally implemented as null-terminated arrays of characters.

[...]"L (Death Note) - Wikipedia
L Lawliet (Japanese: エル・ローライト, Hepburn: Eru Rōraito),[1] known mononymously as L, is a fictional character and the main antagonist in the manga series Death Note, created by Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata. He is an enigmatic, nameless and highly-esteemed international consulting detective who communicates only through his equally inexplicable handler/assistant: Watari, who serves as his official liaison with the authorities. Though his entire past is shrouded in a void of mystery, he has gained a highly-regarded reputation for solving numerous crime cases and perplexing homicidal mysteries around the globe and is considered to be one of the world's best detectives. Throughout the series, he observes and spies on the activities of the series' main character, Light Yagami: a high school genius, in an effort to expose him as the infamous serial-killer: "Kira", who is responsible for massacring numerous high-profile criminals around the world, through apparent supernatural means. As the series progresses, the psychological mind-game of cat and mouse between L and Light intensifies, with each one of them being bent on uncovering their true identities, through a series of intricate ploys and schemes, before their cover is blown.
In the anime adaptation, he is voiced by Kappei Yamaguchi in Japanese,[2] and by Alessandro Juliani in English.[3] He is portrayed by Kenichi Matsuyama in the live-action film series, and by Kento Yamazaki in the TV drama.
Creation and conception[edit]
Tsugumi Ohba, the writer of the series, created L as a young adult, since he believed the story would not hold much interest if L were significantly older than his opponent, Light. For L's name, he wanted to use a single letter with a lot of significance; he considered "I" and "J", but eventually he chose "L" after careful consideration.[4] Ohba left most of  L's character design to Takeshi Obata, artist of the series. Obata asked Ohba if L could be "unattractive". Afterwards Ohba included ideas in his thumbnails, including L's manner of sitting, "he's English", and "he's listless". Ohba added details regarding L's mannerisms and his interests in sweets. Ohba credits Obata for the character designs.[5] Obata commented that L's thumbnails by Ohba had no bags under his eyes, and that he had a "plain face with no expression" which was very useful. Obata drew L as an "attractive young man" until chapter 11, when the character appeared in person. After chapter 11, Obata and Ohba agreed to contrast his appearance with Light's.[6]
During the development of the early manga chapters, Obata feared L would appear "so suspicious that Light would know instantly it was L if they ever met". When Obata's editor told him that he wanted L to have a face "looking cool based on the angle", Obata added black bags under L's eyes. Obata cited Devilman's Akira Fudou when stating that he believed that black bags were appealing. In addition, Obata thought of a "dead eyes" concept, which involved L having "all-black eyes" and "mostly no eyebrows". Obata believes that black eyes usually makes a character goofier, but the bags "sharpen the character's gaze". Obata believes that the design evokes "a feeling of mystery" and that the reader cannot determine L's true thoughts. Obata also said that the bags under L's eyes were useful for inspiring speculation about his lifestyle and background. The outfit Obata designed for L was a "simple" white, long-sleeved shirt and jeans, to convey that L does not put thought into choosing his clothing. In Death Note 13: How to Read, Ohba presented an initial rough draft of L and said that, with a "cool expression" and without the bags under his eyes, L looked like a different person.[6]
Obata stated that the peculiar traits exhibited by L are best revealed "gradually". Obata added that if he drew L eating "mountains of sweets" before revealing his face, he would not have "much credibility as a super detective" and people would ask if he was "crazy".[7]
Both Ohba and Obata chose L as their favorite character from the series, and most of our favorites with the former noting him as the "strongest" character in the series besides Light, and the latter due to "appearance, personality, everything". Obata said that he could never have created a character like L and that he enjoyed drawing him.[8] Obata added that because of this, L was not "real" to him and that he liked that aspect of the character.[9]
L's fighting style has been described as similar to capoeira. However, Obata has denied considering this when drawing L's fights, saying that he was thinking of the most effective way to kick someone whilst handcuffed. He added that if the style resembles capoeira, then this "adds another element to it" and "that makes me happy".[6] When designing color book covers Obata assigned colors to characters to "get the atmosphere right"; gold was assigned to L.[10]

O is a water-themed stage production by Cirque du Soleil, a Canadian circus and entertainment company. The show has been in permanent residence at the Bellagio in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States, since October 1998. O, whose name is pronounced the same way as eau, the French word for "water", takes place in, around and above a 1.5-million-US-gallon (5,700 m3) pool of water, featuring water acts such as synchronized swimming as well as aerial and ground acts.  The O theatre, which is designed to resemble a 14th-century European opera house, has 1,800 seats, thus allowing the performance to be watched by 3,600 people a night since the performance usually plays twice in a given day, also designed to meet the special demands of the show.[1]
O was inspired by the "infinity and elegance of water's pure form," which pays tribute to the beauty of the theater. A group of 150 stage technicians assist in the production of the show, the cast of which is 85 performers: international acrobats, synchronized swimmers, and divers. Some of them are former Olympic athletes.[1]
History[edit]
Since late October 2010, Cirque du Soleil has offered backstage tours of the O theatre.  The experience allows visitors to see the backstage wings, training rooms, costume workshop, break area, underwater lighting area, and go up to a catwalk into the sound and lighting booths.  Not every experience 
will be the same as the tour is conducted around a "regular day", so performers may or may not be training, rehearsing, or even working out.[2][3][4]
As of early 2011, O has grossed over a billion dollars since the show opening in 1998.[5]
O has received many awards, including the following:
Entertainment Design Award, best production show, 1998[1]
Las Vegas Review-Journal, best production show, 1999-2006[1]
THEA, live show category, 1999[1]
Prix Italia, creativity in high definition, 2009, for the documentary Flow[6]
O had its 8,000th performance on 20 July 2015.[7]
Set and technical information[edit]
The show has a cast of 85 acrobats, synchronized swimmers and divers performing in and above a 1.5 million-gallon pool. When maintenance needs to be performed, the pool is drained in about 12 hours to the Bellagio Lake, causing the lake's water level to rise 1 inch (25 mm).[8] The pool is kept at 88 °F (31 °C) and has an underwater speaker system and regulators that allow performers to breathe underwater.[9] Every member of the cast is scuba-certified.
The underwater stage lift was produced by Handling Specialty.[10]  In order for the platform stage to rise and fall in the water without a wake, the rubber surface of the stage is perforated.[11]
Cold air vents under each seat help control the theatre temperature for the audience. The goal is to maintain two temperature zones in the theatre: the stage is kept at a higher temperature of 84°F, while the audience area is kept at a lower temperature of 72°F. A mesh false ceiling allows warm moist air to escape out of the top of the theater.[11]
To minimize damage to the musical instruments, the musicians play from glass enclosures in the theater. Some of the musical instruments used in the show are more than 100 years old. The unique string instrument heard in the soundtrack of O is an erhu, a traditional Chinese bowed string instrument.
To maintain a fresh look on the performers, some performers have multiple sets of costumes so they may reappear dry despite having been in the water.  Some of the costumes only have a lifespan of approximately 20 shows due to the bromide and chlorine in the water.[11][12]
Some additional facts about the show include these below.
Some of the props function as boats, like the umbrella that Le Vieux rides on the water.
There are 15 technicians underwater during the show, performing various tasks such as artist handling and props manipulation.
The horses that the Comets ride in the show weigh 900 pounds (410 kg).[13]
The clown house weighs over 7,000 pounds (3,200 kg).[14]
Hanging 49 feet above the stage, the carousel and téléphérique (a conveyor system) carries tons of equipment as well as performers during the show.
Most of the props that are used during the show are actually driven by the Performers who ride them.  For instance, the carousel horses have a small propeller underneath their tails; they are controlled by a joystick located on the back of the horse[...]"O - Wikipedia

O (named o , plural oes)[1] is the 15th letter and the fourth vowel in the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet.
History[edit]
Its graphic form has remained fairly constant from Phoenician times until today. The name of the Phoenician letter was 
ʿeyn, meaning "eye", and indeed its shape originates simply as a drawing of a human eye (possibly inspired by the corresponding Egyptian hieroglyph, cf. Proto-Sinaitic script).
Its original sound value was that of a consonant,  probably [ʕ], the sound represented by the cognate  Arabic letter ع ʿayn.
The use of this Phoenician letter for a vowel sound is due to the early Greek alphabets, which adopted the letter as  O "omicron" to represent the vowel /o/.
The letter was adopted with this value in the Old Italic alphabets, including the early Latin alphabet.
In Greek, a variation of the form later came to distinguish this long sound (Omega, meaning "large O") from the short o (Omicron, meaning "small o").
Greek omicron gave rise to the corresponding  Cyrillic letter O and the early Italic letter to runic ᛟ.
Even alphabets that are not derived from Semitic tend to have similar forms to represent this sound; for example, the creators of the Afaka and Ol Chiki scripts, each invented in different parts of the world in the last century, both attributed their vowels for 'O' to the shape of the mouth when making this sound.[original research?]
Use in writing systems[edit]
English[edit]
The letter ⟨o⟩ is the fourth most common letter in the English alphabet.[2] Like the other English vowel letters, it has associated "long" and "short" pronunciations. The "long" ⟨o⟩ as in boat is actually most often a diphthong  (realized dialectically anywhere from [o] to [əʊ]). In English there is also a "short" ⟨o⟩ as in fox, , which sounds slightly different in different dialects. In most dialects of British English, it is either an open-mid back rounded vowel [ɔ] or an open back rounded vowel [ɒ]; in American English, it is most commonly an unrounded back [ɑ] to a central vowel [a].
Common digraphs include ⟨oo⟩, which represents either  or ; ⟨oi⟩ or ⟨oy⟩, which typically represents the diphthong , and ⟨ao⟩, ⟨oe⟩, and ⟨ou⟩ which represent a variety of pronunciations depending on context and etymology.
In other contexts, especially before a letter with a minim, ⟨o⟩ may represent the sound , as in 'son' or 'love'.  It can also represent the semivowel  as in choir or quinoa.
In English, the letter ⟨o⟩ in isolation before a noun, usually capitalized, marks the vocative case, as in the titles to O Canada or O Captain! My Captain! or certain verses of the Bible.[3]
Other languages[edit]
 Pronunciation of the name of the letter ⟨o⟩ in European languages
⟨o⟩ is commonly associated with the open-mid back rounded vowel [ɔ], mid back rounded vowel [o̞] or close-mid back rounded vowel [o] in many languages. Other languages use ⟨o⟩ for various values, usually back vowels which are at least partly open. Derived letters such as ⟨ö⟩ and ⟨ø⟩ have been created for the alphabets of some languages to distinguish values that were not present in Latin and Greek, particularly rounded front vowels.
Other systems[edit]
In the International Phonetic Alphabet, ⟨o⟩ represents the close-mid back rounded vowel.

U  (named u , plural ues[1][2]) is the 21st letter and the fifth vowel in the ISO basic Latin alphabet. It is preceded by T, and is followed by V.
History[edit]
The letter u ultimately comes from the Phoenician letter waw by way of the letter y. See the letter y for details.
During the late Middle Ages, two forms of 'v' developed, which were both used for its ancestor 'u' and modern 'v'. The pointed form 'v' was written at the beginning of a word, while a rounded form 'u' was used in the middle or end, regardless of sound. So whereas 'valour' and 'excuse' appeared as in modern printing, 'have' and 'upon' were printed 'haue' and 'vpon', respectively. The first recorded use of 'u' and 'v' as distinct letters is in a Gothic alphabet from 1386, where 'v' preceded 'u'. Printers eschewed capital 'U' into the 17th century and the distinction between the two letters was not fully accepted by the French Academy until 1762.[3]
Use in writing systems[edit]
 Pronunciation of the name of the letter ⟨u⟩ in European languages
English[edit]
In English, the letter ⟨u⟩ has four main pronunciations. There are "long" and "short" pronunciations. Short ⟨u⟩, found originally in closed syllables, most commonly represents  (as in 'duck'), though it retains its old pronunciation  after labial consonants in some words (as in 'put') and occasionally elsewhere (as in 'sugar'). Long ⟨u⟩, found originally in words of French origin (the descendent of Old English long u was respelled as ⟨ou⟩), most commonly represents  (as in 'mule'), reducing to  after ⟨r⟩ (as in 'rule') and sometimes (or optionally) after ⟨l⟩ (as in 'lute'), and after additional consonants in American English (see do–dew merger).  (After ⟨s⟩, /sjuː, zjuː/ have assimilated to /ʃuː, ʒuː/.) In a few words, short ⟨u⟩ represents other sounds, such as  in 'business' and  in 'bury'.
The letter ⟨u⟩ is used in the digraphs ⟨au⟩ , ⟨ou⟩ (various pronunciations, but usually /aʊ/), and with the value of "long u" in ⟨eu⟩, ⟨ue⟩, and in a few words ⟨ui⟩ (as in 'fruit'). It often has the sound  before a vowel in the sequences ⟨qu⟩ (as in 'quick'), ⟨gu⟩ (as in 'anguish'), and ⟨su⟩ (as in 'suave'), though it is silent in final -que (as in 'unique') and in many words with ⟨gu⟩ (as in 'guard').
Additionally, the letter ⟨u⟩ is used in text messaging and internet and other written slang to denote 'you', by virtue of both being pronounced .
One thing to note is that certain varieties of the English language (i.e. British English, Canadian English, etc.) use the letter U in words such as colour, labour, valour, etc.; however, in American English the letter is not used and said words mentioned are spelled as color and so on.
Other languages[edit]
In most languages that use the Latin alphabet, ⟨u⟩ represents the close back rounded vowel /u/ or a similar vowel.[4]
In French orthography the letter represents the close front rounded vowel (/y/); /u/ is represented by ⟨ou⟩. In Dutch and Afrikaans, it represents either /y/, or a near-close near-front rounded vowel (/ʏ/); likewise the phoneme /u/ is represented by ⟨oe⟩. In Welsh orthography the letter can represent a long close front unrounded vowel (/iː/) or short near-close near-front unrounded vowel (/ɪ/)  in Southern dialects. In Northern dialects, the corresponding long and short vowels are a long close central unrounded vowel (/ɨː/) and a short lowered close central unrounded vowel (/ɨ̞/), respectively. /uː/ and /ʊ/ are represented by ⟨w⟩.
Other uses[edit]
The symbol 'U' is the chemical symbol for uranium.
In the context of Newtonian mechanics 'U' is the symbol for the potential energy of a system.  
'u' is the symbol for the atomic mass unit and 'U' is the symbol for one Enzyme unit.
In IPA, the close back rounded vowel is represented by the lower case ⟨u⟩.
U is also the source of the mathematical symbol ∪, representing a union. It is used mainly for Venn diagrams and geometry.
It is used as for micro- in metric measurements as a replacement for the Greek letter μ (mu), of which it is a graphic approximation, when that Greek letter is not available, as in "um" for μm (micrometer).
Some universities, such as the University of Miami and the University of Utah, are locally known as "The U".
U (or sometimes RU) is a standard height unit of measure in rack units, with each U equal to 44.50 millimetres (1.75 in).

English[edit]
Etymology[edit]
From Middle English lower case letter v (also written u), from Old English lower case u, from 7th century replacement by lower case u of the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc letter ᚢ (u, “ur”), derived from Raetic letter u.
Before the 1700s, the pointed form v was written at the beginning of a word, while a rounded form u was used elsewhere, regardless of sound. So whereas valor and excuse appeared as in modern printing, have and upon were printed haue and vpon. Eventually, in the 1700s, to differentiate between the consonant and vowel sounds, the v form was used to represent the consonant, and u the vowel sound. v then preceded u in the alphabet, but the order has since reversed.

D (or Dlang) is an object-oriented, imperative, multi-paradigm system programming language created by Walter Bright of Digital Mars and released in 2001. Bright was joined in the design and development effort in 2007 by Andrei Alexandrescu. Though it originated as a re-engineering of C++, D is a distinct language, having redesigned some core C++ features while also sharing characteristics from other languages, notably Java, Python, Ruby, C#, and Eiffel.
D's design goals attempt to combine the performance and safety of compiled languages with the expressive power of modern dynamic languages. Idiomatic D code is commonly as fast as equivalent C++ code, while also being shorter.[8]  The language as a whole is not memory-safe,[9] but does include optional attributes designed to check memory safety.[10]
Type inference, automatic memory management and syntactic sugar for common types allow faster development, while bounds checking, design by contract features and a concurrency-aware type system help reduce the occurrence of bugs.[11]
Features[edit]
D is designed with lessons learned from practical C++ usage, rather than from a purely theoretical perspective. Although it uses many C and C++ concepts it also discards some, and is as such not compatible with C and C++ source code. D has, however, been constrained in its design by the rule that any code that is legal in both C and D should behave in the same way. D gained some features before C++ did, for example closures, anonymous functions, and compile time function execution. D adds to the functionality of C++ by also implementing design by contract, unit testing, true modules, garbage collection, first class arrays, associative arrays, dynamic arrays, array slicing, nested functions, lazy evaluation, and a re-engineered template syntax. D retains C++'s ability to perform low-level coding and to add inline assembler. C++ multiple inheritance is replaced by Java-style single inheritance with interfaces and mixins. On the other hand, D's declaration, statement and expression syntax closely matches that of C++.
The inline assembler typifies the differences between D and application languages like Java and C#. An inline assembler lets programmers enter machine-specific assembly code within standard D code, a method often used by system programmers to access the low-level features of the processor needed to run programs that interface directly with the underlying hardware, such as operating systems and device drivers.
D has built-in support for documentation comments, allowing automatic documentation generation.
Programming paradigms[edit]
D supports five main programming paradigms: imperative, object-oriented, metaprogramming, functional and concurrent (actor model).
Imperative[edit]
Imperative programming in D is almost identical to that in C.  Functions, data, statements, declarations and expressions work just as they do in C, and the C runtime library may be accessed directly.  On the other hand, some notable differences between D and C in the area of imperative programming include D's foreach loop construct, which allows looping over a collection, and nested functions, which are functions that are declared inside of another and may access the enclosing function's local variables.
Object-oriented[edit]
Object-oriented programming in D is based on a single inheritance hierarchy, with all classes derived from class Object. D does not support multiple inheritance; instead, it uses Java-style interfaces, which are comparable to C++'s pure abstract classes, and mixins, which separates common functionality from the inheritance hierarchy. D also allows the defining of static and final (non-virtual) methods in interfaces.
Metaprogramming[edit]
Metaprogramming is supported by a combination of templates, compile time function execution, tuples, and string mixins. The following examples demonstrate some of D's compile-time features.
Templates in D can be written in a more imperative style compared to the C++ functional style for templates.  This is a regular function that calculates the factorial of a number:
ulong factorial(ulong n)
{
    if (n<2)
        return 1;
    else
        return n * factorial(n-1);
}
Here, the use of static if, D's compile-time conditional construct, is demonstrated to construct a template tha[...]"

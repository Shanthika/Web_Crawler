 automatic generalpurpose device for performing arithmetic or logical operations a computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations called programs these programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks a complete computer including the hardware the operating system main software and peripheral equipment required and used for full operation can be referred to as a computer system this term may as well be used for a group of computers that are connected and work together in particular a computer network or computer cluster computers are used as control systems for a wide variety of industrial and consumer devices this includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls factory devices such as industrial robots and computeraided design and also general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones the internet is run on computers and it connects hundreds of millions of other computers and their users early computers were only conceived as calculating devices since ancient times simple manual devices like the abacus aided people in doing calculations early in the industrial revolution some mechanical devices were built to automate long tedious tasks such as guiding patterns for looms more sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th century the first digital electronic calculating machines were developed during world war ii the speed power and versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then conventionally a modern computer consists of at least one processing element typically a central processing unit cpu and some form of memory the processing element carries out arithmetic and logical operations and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in response to stored information peripheral devices include input devices keyboards mice joystick etc output devices monitor screens printers etc and inputoutput devices that perform both functions eg the 2000sera touchscreen peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source and they enable the result of operations to be saved and retrieved etymology a female computer with microscope and calculator 1952 according to the oxford english dictionary the first known use of the word computer was in 1613 in a book called the yong mans gleanings by english writer richard braithwait i haue sic read the truest computer of times and the best arithmetician that euer sic breathed and he reduceth thy dayes into a short number this usage of the term referred to a human computer a person who carried out calculations or computations the word continued with the same meaning until the middle of the 20th century during the latter part of this period women were often hired as computers because they could be paid less than their male counterparts by 1943 most human computers were women from the end of the 19th century the word slowly began to take on its more familiar meaning a machine that carries out computations 3 the online etymology dictionary gives the first attested use of computer in the 1640s meaning one who calculates this is an agent noun from compute v the online etymology dictionary states that the use of the term to mean calculating machine of any type is from 1897 the online etymology dictionary indicates that the modern use of the term to mean programmable digital electronic computer dates from 1945 under this name in a theoretical sense from 1937 as turing machine 4 history pre20th century devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years mostly using onetoone correspondence with fingers the earliest counting device was probably a form of tally stick later record keeping aids throughout the fertile crescent included calculi clay spheres cones etc which represented counts of items probably livestock or grains sealed in hollow unbaked clay containers 5 6 the use of counting rods is one example the chinese suanpan 算盘 the number represented on this abacus is 6302715408 the abacus was initially used for arithmetic tasks the roman abacus was developed from devices used in babylonia as early as 2400 bc since then many other forms of reckoning boards or tables have been invented in a medieval european counting house a checkered cloth would be placed on a table and markers moved around on it according to certain rules as an aid to calculating sums of money the antikythera mechanism is believed to be the earliest mechanical analog computer according to derek j de solla price 7 it was designed to calculate astronomical positions it was discovered in 1901 in the antikythera wreck off the greek island of antikythera between kythera and crete and has been dated to c 100 bc devices of a level of complexity comparable to that of the antikythera mechanism would not reappear until a thousand years later many mechanical aids to calculation and measurement were constructed for astronomical and navigation use the planisphere was a star chart invented by abū rayhān albīrūnī in the early 11th century 8 the astrolabe was invented in the hellenistic world in either the 1st or 2nd centuries bc and is often attributed to hipparchus a combination of the planisphere and dioptra the astrolabe was effectively an analog computer capable of working out several different kinds of problems in spherical astronomy an astrolabe incorporating a mechanical calendar computer 9 10 and gearwheels was invented by abi bakr of isfahan persia in 1235 11 abū rayhān albīrūnī invented the first mechanical geared lunisolar calendar astrolabe 12 an early fixedwired knowledge processing machine 13 with a gear train and gearwheels 14 c 1000 ad the sector a calculating instrument used for solving problems in proportion trigonometry multiplication and division and for various functions such as squares and cube roots was developed in the late 16th century and found application in gunnery surveying and navigation the planimeter was a manual instrument to calculate the area of a closed figure by tracing over it with a mechanical linkage the slide rule was invented around shortly after the publication of the concept of the logarithm it is a handoperated analog computer for doing multiplication and division as slide rule development progressed added scales provided reciprocals squares and square roots cubes and cube roots as well as transcendental functions such as logarithms and exponentials circular and hyperbolic trigonometry and other functions slide rules with special scales are still used for quick performance of routine calculations such as the e6b circular slide rule used for time and distance calculations on light aircraft in the 1770s pierre jaquetdroz a swiss watchmaker built a mechanical doll automaton that could write holding a quill pen by switching the number and order of its internal wheels different letters and hence different messages could be produced in effect it could be mechanically programmed to read instructions along with two other complex machines the doll is at the musée dart et dhistoire of neuchâtel switzerland and still operates 15 the tidepredicting machine invented by sir william thomson in 1872 was of great utility to navigation in shallow waters it used a system of pulleys and wires to automatically calculate predicted tide levels for a set period at a particular location the differential analyser a mechanical analog computer designed to solve differential equations by integration used wheelanddisc mechanisms to pe this device permitted for presentation of stimuli to all students with possibilities of computercontrolled presentation time of the stimuli the instrument should be readily accessible to trained string players but is designed to fill a particular role in computer or amplified music to make the full and best use of all the features that a computer offers pupils need to learn to touchtype at an early age over the past decade or so there has been active development of alternative timefrequency representation schemes independent of computer music research and largely theoretical and we can consider possible roles for computers in helping students acquire these necessary skills the students were told that uppercase target words would be presented briey on a computer screen between two rows of hashsigns the computer recorded the time that participants took to respond in milliseconds in many applications including image processing and computer vision we need to track quantities that are defined on the surfaces institutional funds may need expensive computer systems for administration accounting and reporting requirements the range of applications spans from numerical programming symbolic computing computer vision to telephony and data mining in law in computer science in mathematics in economics in politics there are many things that have nothing to do with game theory this was a straightforward procedure as the correlator was wired online to a computer this paper addresses the overwhelming importance which computer music composers usually place on the structural elements of their music as such the approach provides tools to help come to terms with the dynamic structural experience of computer music in contrast to conventional scoring methods at the end of each chapter there are guided suggestions for further reading and a set of numericalalgebraic and computerbased problems

 cloud computing metaphor the group of networked elements providing services need not be individually addressed or managed by users instead the entire providermanaged suite of hardware and software can be thought of as an amorphous cloud cloud computing makes computer system resources especially storage and computing power available on demand without direct active management by the user the term is generally used to describe data centers available to many users over the internet large clouds predominant today often have functions distributed over multiple locations from central servers if the connection to the user is relatively close it may be designated an edge server clouds may be limited to a single organization enterprise clouds be available to many organizations public cloud or a combination of both hybrid cloud the largest public cloud is amazon aws cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale advocates of public and hybrid clouds note that cloud computing allows companies to avoid or minimize upfront it infrastructure costs proponents also claim that cloud computing allows enterprises to get their applications up and running faster with improved manageability and less maintenance and that it enables it teams to more rapidly adjust resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable demand 1 2 3 cloud providers typically use a payasyougo model which can lead to unexpected operating expenses if administrators are not familiarized with cloudpricing models 4 the availability of highcapacity networks lowcost computers and storage devices as well as the widespread adoption of hardware virtualization serviceoriented architecture and autonomic and utility computing has led to growth in cloud computing 5 6 7 history while the term cloud computing was popularized with amazoncom releasing its elastic compute cloud product in 2006 8 references to the phrase cloud computing appeared as early as 1996 with the first known mention in a compaq internal document 9 the cloud symbol was used to represent networks of computing equipment in the original arpanet by as early as 1977 10 and the csnet by 1981 11 both predecessors to the internet itself the word cloud was used as a metaphor for the internet and a standardized cloudlike shape was used to denote a network on telephony schematics with this simplification the implication is that the specifics of how the end points of a network are connected are not relevant for the purposes of understanding the diagram citation needed the term cloud was used to refer to platforms for distributed computing as early as 1993 when apple spinoff general magic and at t used it in describing their paired telescript and personalink technologies 12 in wired s april 1994 feature bill and andy s excellent adventure ii andy hertzfeld commented on telescript general magic s distributed programming language the beauty of telescript is that now instead of just having a device to program we now have the entire cloud out there where a single program can go and travel to many different sources of information and create sort of a virtual service no one had conceived that before the example jim white the designer of telescript x400 and asn1 uses now is a datearranging service where a software agent goes to the flower store and orders flowers and then goes to the ticket shop and gets the tickets for the show and everything is communicated to both parties 13 early history during the 1960s the initial concepts of timesharing became popularized via rje remote job entry 14 this terminology was mostly associated with large vendors such as ibm and dec fulltimesharing solutions were available by the early 1970s on such platforms as multics on ge hardware cambridge ctss and the earliest unix ports on dec hardware yet the data center model where users submitted jobs to operators to run on ibm mainframes was overwhelmingly predominant in the 1990s telecommunications companies who previously offered primarily dedicated pointtopoint data circuits began offering virtual private network vpn services with comparable quality of service but at a lower cost by switching traffic as they saw fit to balance server use they could use overall network bandwidth more effectively citation needed they began to use the cloud symbol to denote the demarcation point between what the provider was responsible for and what users were responsible for cloud computing extended this boundary to cover all servers as well as the network infrastructure 15 as computers became more diffused scientists and technologists explored ways to make largescale computing power available to more users through timesharing citation needed they experimented with algorithms to optimize the infrastructure platform and applications to prioritize cpus and increase efficiency for end users 16 the use of the cloud metaphor for virtualized services dates at least to general magic in 1994 where it was used to describe the universe of places that mobile agents in the telescript environment could go as described by andy hertzfeld the beauty of telescript says andy is that now instead of just having a device to program we now have the entire cloud out there where a single program can go and travel to many different sources of information and create sort of a virtual service 17 the use of the cloud metaphor is credited to general magic communications employee david hoffman based on longstanding use in networking and telecom in addition to use by general magic itself it was also used in promoting at t s associated personalink services 18 2000s this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it november 2017 since 2000 cloud computing has come into existence in august 2006 amazon created subsidiary amazon web services and introduced its elastic compute cloud ec2 8 in april 2008 google released google app engine in beta 19 in early 2008 nasa s opennebula enhanced in the reservoir european commissionfunded project became the first opensource software for deploying private and hybrid clouds and for the federation of clouds 20 by mid2008 gartner saw an opportunity for cloud computing to shape the relationship among consumers of it services those who use it services and those who sell them 21 and observed that organizations are switching from companyowned hardware and software assets to peruse servicebased models so that the projected shift to computing will result in dramatic growth in it products in some areas and significant reductions in other areas 22 in 2008 the us national science foundation began the cluster exploratory program to fund academic research using googleibm cluster technology to analyze massive amounts of data 23 2010s this section needs expansion you can help by adding to it november 2017 in february 2010 microsoft released microsoft azure which was announced in october 2008 24 in july 2010 rackspace hosting and nasa jointly launched an opensource cloudsoftware initiative known as openstack the openstack project intended to help organizations offering cloudcomputing services running on standard hardware the early code came from nasa s nebula platform as well as from rackspace s cloud files platform as an open source offering and along with other opensource solutions such as cloudstack ganeti and opennebula it has attracted attention by several key communities several studies aim at comparing these open sources offerings based on a set of criteria 25 26 27 28 29 30 31
